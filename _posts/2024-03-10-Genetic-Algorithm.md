### ArtificialLife Project
**Code are listed under different branches**

**Step 1: Basic Simulation with Mujoco**

*Objective:* 
Introduce a basic body structure into the simulation.

*Tasks:*
1. Create a simulated body in mujoco.
2. Implement movement capabilities.

**Step 2: Genotype to Phenotype**

*Objective:* 
Implement the directed graph genotype-to-phenotype conversion for creating 3D creatures, as described in Karl Sims's paper "Evolving 3D Morphology and Behavior by Competition."

*Tasks:*

Develop the genotype-to-phenotype mapping for 3D creature creation.

**Step 3: Fitness Function and Iterative Simulations.**

*Objective:* 
This step procedurally generate random bodies and evaluate the bodies in simulation according to a fitness measure of your choosing.

*Tasks:*
1. Modify the fitness function to favor the distance traveled.
2. Using the best feature with highest fittness score as a baseline to do subsequent evolutions. 

**Step 4: Evolutionary Mutations and Stability.**

*Objective:* 
I built a Hand Shearing Auxetics (HSA) as a basic unit. This step procedurally generate different configurations of HSA, and explore which kind of configuration will move faster. 

*Tasks:*
1. Programming an evoluntionary process, keep adding HSA unit in each iteration.
2. Delete the configurations with lower fitness scores.
3. Randomly add a HSA unit in different positions.
