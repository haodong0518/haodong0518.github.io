In Summer 2022, I joined the Durr, USA as an engineering designer.

DÃ¼rr Universal provides pre-engineered combustion turbine filter houses or custom engineered air intake systems. From the May 2022 to September 2022, I mainly work on the evaporative cooler system, an air intake system enhencing the power plant efficiency by decreasing the inlet air temperature. 

Most power plants are located in the desert away from the city. The inlet air temperatrue is too high to keep a higher power generator efficiency. The evaporative cooler system pumps water on a higher position and splash the water out to decrease the inlet air temperature.
