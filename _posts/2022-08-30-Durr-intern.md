Dürr Universal provides pre-engineered combustion turbine filter houses or custom-engineered air intake systems. In the summer of 2022, I joined Dürr as an engineering designer. From May 2022 to September 2022, my main focus was on the evaporative cooler system, an air intake system enhancing power plant efficiency by decreasing the inlet air temperature.

_The Principle of the evaporative cooler_

An evaporative cooling system takes basic evaporation and automates it to efficiently lower the air temperature. Typically, the machine consists of a fan, a thick pad, a water reservoir, and additional controls for fine-tuning. The fan draws dry, hot air into the machine and across the cooler pads. These thick pads absorb water from the reservoir and have multiple layers to increase surface area. As the hot air crosses the pad, water molecules on the surface evaporate, causing the air temperature inside the cooler to drop — often by as much as 20 degrees. The fan then blows the cold air into your room, providing relief on a hot day.

_The Evaporative Cooler_

Most power plants are located in the desert, away from cities, where the inlet air temperature is too high to maintain higher power generator efficiency. The evaporative cooler system pumps water to a higher position and splashes it out. When the inlet air passes through the evaporative cooler, the temperature decreases, enhancing power generation efficiency.

Unlike evaporative cooler systems used at home, industrial evaporative coolers often consist of several floors. The hydraulic system includes tubes, pumps, flow meters, valves, and pressure gauges.

Based on the custom requirements, I designed the pipeline using fluid dynamics principles such as the Continuity Equation, Bernoulli's Equation, and Navier-Stokes Equations. After basic calculations, I used Creo to draw the pipeline for each part, then quoted the entire project for the manager using the SAP system.

Thank you for the opportunity! I learned about how mechanical engineering works in the industry and how technical details are crucial in business.
